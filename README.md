# Algorithms and complexity analysis tex

This repository contains LaTeX project containing answers to some exam questions on algorithms and complexity analysis.

## About
Some of the answers to questions were not included in this project (it remained in my notebooks), but I believe that this repository is still able to help my classmates prepare for the exam.

## Note
Despite the fact that a huge part of the material was taken from open sources (for example, Wikipedia), in some places I reasoned independently, so I recommend that you not be sure of the absolute truthfulness of what was written.

## Thanks
* [@airh4ck](https://github.com/airh4ck) for preamble
* [@i-pankrat](https://github.com/i-pankrat) for one written answer to the question
